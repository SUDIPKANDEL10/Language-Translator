# Language-Translator
This project aims to create a python program to read user text and convert it to the desired language.

This Python script uses the googletrans library and Tkinter to create a simple GUI-based language translator. The translator allows users to input text and specify source and destination languages for translation. The script retrieves user inputs, including text and language preferences, and uses the Google Translate API to perform the translation. The translated text is displayed in a message box. The GUI also includes a "Clear" button to reset input fields. Overall, the script provides a user-friendly interface for language translation using Google Translate.
